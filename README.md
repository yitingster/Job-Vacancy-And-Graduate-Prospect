# Job Vacancy And Graduates' Prospect Analysis

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>
Hello everyone, this is an assignment that I did for my Specialist Diploma in Data Science course from Singapore Polytechnic.
The assignment requires us to use datasets from <a href="https://data.gov.sg/">data.gov.sg</a> and derive insights from two topic of interests.
The downloaded datasets can be found in the "Data" folder in the repository.     
</p>  

<p>
    I highly recommend to look at the <b>slides(Job-Vacancy-and-Graduates-Prospect-Slides.pdf)</b> in the repository for a detailed walkthrough of the data exploration, preperation and graph plotting process using python; the analysis and interpretation of the graphs are also included in the slides.   
</p>    
    
<h1>Topics</h1>

The two topics that I have worked on and datasets used are as follow:

<dl>
  <dt>1. Job vacancy over the years</dt>
  <dd>- Job vacancy: job-vacancy-topline.csv</dd>
  <dd>- Job vacany by industry: job-vacancy-by-industry-level-2.csv</dd>
  <dd>- GDP datasets: per-capita-gni-and-per-capita-gdp-at-current-prices-annual.csv</dd>
  
  <dt>2. University Graduates' Prospect </dt>
  <dd>- Graduate Emplyoment Survey: graduate-employment-survey-ntu-nus-sit-smu-suss-sutd.csv </dd>
</dl>


<h1>Skillsets</h1>

Below are the skillsets that I have learnt through this assignment:


<ul>
    <li>Data exploration (descriptive statistic, identifying missing data)</li>
    <li>Data preperation for graph plotting</li>
    <li>Graph plotting using seaborn (scatter, bar, line, box-and-whisker)</li>
    <li>SQL to python (From Python platform, connect to SQL and extract data using SQL syntax) </li>
  </ul>
