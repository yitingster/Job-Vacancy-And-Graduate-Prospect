# Job-Vacancy-And-Graduate-Prospect

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>
Hello everyone, this is an assignment that I did for my Specialist Diploma in Data Science course from Singapore Polytechnic.
The assignment requires us to choose datasets from <a href="https://data.gov.sg/">data.gov.sg</a> and derive insights from two topic of interests.
The downloaded datasets can be found in the "Data" folder in the repository. 
    
</p>  
The two topics that I have worked on and the datasets used are as follow:

<dl>
  <dt>1. Job vacancy over the years</dt>
  <dd>- Job vacancy: job-vacancy-topline.csv</dd>
  <dd>- Job vacany by industry: job-vacancy-by-industry-level-2.csv</dd>
  <dd>- GDP datasets: per-capita-gni-and-per-capita-gdp-at-current-prices-annual.csv</dd>
  
  <dt>2. University Graduates' Prospect </dt>
